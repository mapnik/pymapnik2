Introduction
==========================

.. contents::

Official mapnik bindings repackaged in the distutils way to facilitate deployments.

This depends of those libraries to be installed on you environment:

    - mapnik2 (the c++ library)
    - BOOST c++:

        - boost python
        - boost thread
        - boost regex

Optionnal but heavily recommended python libraries

    - pycairo
    - PIL / Pillow

If you are a buildout user, you can look at this package
buildout which integrates pycairo & pil installation

See `github <https://github.com/mapnik/pymapnik2>`_


MAPNIK2 Notes
===============

The python bindings are tied to the mapnik2 library version.

To use with:

    - :mapnik2 library - 2.0.1: == mapnik2 2.0.1.3
       ::

        easy_install -U mapnik2==2.0.1.3


    - :mapnik2 library - 2.1.0: == mapnik2 2.1.0
       ::

        easy_install -U mapnik2==2.1.0


    - :mapnik2 library - 2.2.0: == mapnik2 2.2.0
       ::

        easy_install -U mapnik2==2.2.0

Installation
======================================
Prerequisites
-------------------
Don't forget that you can play with LDFLAGS/CFLAGS/LD_LIBRARY_PATH dto indicate non standart locations for the following requirements if it applies.

You will have to have the includes and libraries for

    - The mapnik-config utility to be in your $PATH
    - Boost_python linked to your python interpreter
      If it is not installed in standart envionments, you ll have to handle the CFLAGS/LDFLAGS to find it, or use minitage ;)
    - cairo / cairomm (optionnal but enabled if you compiled mapnik with cairo support)
    - mapnik2
    - The current python interpreter
    - pycairo / PIL in the PYTHONPATH somehow

Buildout
----------
Some developers use buildout_ to ease deployments.
* Say where to find mapnik-config by settings correctly your PATH environment variable
* Add ``mapnik`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.
::

    [buildout]
    parts = somepart

    [somepart]
    recipe = minitage.recipe.scripts # or zc.recipe.egg ...
    eggs = mapnik2

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can read the buildout installation shipped with this egg for inspiration of how integrate mapnik in a buildout.
The magic is using buildout.minitagificator to feed PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PYTHONPATH with pycairo


Running this package buildout
--------------------------------
First you need to install pycairo locally::

    bin/buildout -vvvvvNc cairo.cfg

Then run buildout::

    bin/buildout -vvvvvN

Easy_install with or without virtualenv
---------------------------------------------
::

    virtualenv --no-site-packages test
    source test/bin/activate
    easy_install mapnik2

* Say where to find mapnik-config by settings correctly your PATH environment variable
* When you're reading this you have probably already run
  ``easy_install mapnik2``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall


BOOST NOTES
--------------

To specify which boostpython lib to link against, you can use, you can use the following::

    export MAPNIK2_BOOST_PYTHON="libboost_python.so.1:libboost_thread.so.1"

Where you have on your filesystem::

    /usr/lib/libboost_python.so.1
    /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1

For ubuntu users, please refer to `this doc <https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/wiki/UbuntuInstallation>`_ to install the prerequisites of this egg.

Minitage
--------------
Some developers use minitage_ to ease deployments (a layer upon buildout).
Indeed, it takes care a lot of things like those boring compilation flags.
As an example, to work on this egg in development mode, you can boostrap it by doing this::
::

    easy_install -U virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute ~/minitage
    mkdir ~/minitage/others

Install minitage, if you haven't yet ::

    source ~/minitage/bin/activate
    easy_install -U minitage.core

Initialize it (**mandatory**) ::

    source ~/minitage/bin/activate
    minimerge -s

To install the minilay for the mapnik2 egg development you can do
::

    cd  ~/minitage/others
    git clone https://github.com/mapnik/pymapnik2.git mapnik-egg-(py26 or py27)
    ln -fs ~/minitage/others/mapnik-egg*/minilays/mapnik-egg/  ~/minitage/minilays/mapnik-egg
    #for python-2.6
    minimerge -av mapnik-egg-py26
    #for python-2.7
    minimerge -av mapnik-egg-py27


Enjoy your installation
::

    cd ~/minitage/others/mapnik-egg-py26
    or cd ~/minitage/others/mapnik-egg-py27
    ./bin/mypy
    >>> import mapnik2

For using mapnik2 inside your minitagified application:

    - Inside the eggs parts of you buildout add::

        [part]
        eggs += mapnik2

    - In your minibuild, merge the mapnik2 dependencies that you can find here:

        - for python2.6: https://github.com/mapnik/pymapnik2/blob/master/minilays/mapnik-egg/mapnik-egg-py26
        - for python2.7: https://github.com/mapnik/pymapnik2/blob/master/minilays/mapnik-egg/mapnik-egg-py27

    - Reminimerge your project to build the mapnik2 egg
    - Then add mapnik2 to your setup.py or buildout for it to be grabbed in your pythonpath.
    - Rerun buildout, you're done
